<h2>Generalizing <em> A Sentiment Analysis of Medical Text Based on Deep Learning </em></h2>

<h2>Research Question</h2>

<p>Yinan Chen's <em> A Sentiment Analysis of Medical Text Based on Deep Learning </em> [1] presents a neural network model based on a combination of pre-existing ideas (such as BERT, convolutional neural networks, and fully connected networks) to tackle the problem of medical discourse often being too complex and nuanced to be analyzed using traditional sentiment analysis tools. </p>
<p>The object of this investigation is to determine whether the conclusions from Chen's paper, specifically about the effectiveness of combining BERT encoding with a convolutional neural network to maximize the accuracy of sentiment analysis, can be generalized to tweets about various subject matters, which carry a vast array of different sentiments. The paper emphasized the specific reasons why medical discourse was so understudied and hinted that the combination of BERT with a convolutional network specifically worked to alleviate these concerns, but it would be interesting to investigate whether this combination would maximize sentiment analysis accuracy on a set of tweets covering a broad range of topics, or if CNNs are inherently superior in circumstances where sentiment is not as easily determined.</p>
<p>The tweet samples used in this investigation come from a webscraped dataset located on Kaggle, where the sentiment score has been calculated using unigram and bigram analysis and various classification techniques, with support vector machine (SVM) being the most accurate. [2] These unigrams and bigrams were compared with a dataset from TwittRatr, which compiled the most commonly flagged positive- and negative-sentiment words from a Twitter API. </p>

<h2>Paper Summary</h2>

<p>The paper discusses the potential challenges of conducting accurate sentiment analysis, focusing specifically on medical texts. Understanding sentiment, whether positive, negative, or neutral, in medical discourse is crucial for enhancing service quality and patient satisfaction. However, sentiment analysis in the medical domain presents unique challenges, including limited datasets and the intricate nature of medical language. These problems are amplified when medical discourse takes to social media cites like Twitter in two additional areas. First, there are often many parties involved and often in the same tweet, a user might be addressing multiple parties with varying sentiments, such that the composite idea may not have a sentiment in any one clear direction. Second, although the discussion of medical topics should be nuanced, evidence-based, and come from objective scientific fact, rather than clouded by one's personal opinions or biases.</p>
<p>To tackle these challenges, the author employs deep learning techniques, leveraging the power of the BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) model as a foundation, integrating it with various deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), fully connected networks (FCNs), and graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Each architecture offers distinct advantages in processing textual data, ranging from capturing local features to understanding complex semantic relationships.</p>
<p>The experiments are conducted on the METS-CoV dataset, a collection of medical-related tweets concerning COVID-19. This dataset provides a source of real-world medical discourse, allowing for comprehensive analysis of sentiment patterns. The findings reveal that CNN models, when combined with BERT, exhibit superior performance in sentiment analysis tasks when compared with other deep learning techniques, particularly on smaller medical text datasets like METS-CoV. This highlights the significance of model selection and architecture in achieving effective sentiment analysis results within the medical domain. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into sentiment analysis in medical texts, offering a roadmap for future research endeavors in NLP applications within the medical field. By bridging the gap between deep learning techniques and medical discourse analysis, this study opens the possibility for developing more efficient and accurate sentiment analysis models tailored to the complexities of healthcare communication.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/becsedy/The-Generalizability-of-Neural-Network-Based-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Medical-Discourse/blob/main/nn_final.ipynb">The code</a> begins by loading 10,000 randomly sampled tweets from the dataset, with pre-assigned positive and negative sentiment classifications. This implementation of the research question, although aiming to emulate Chen's methodology as much as possible, deviated slightly from what was outlined in the original paper. First, this dataset did not include a "neutral" sentiment, which was a convenient means for simplifying the problem as a "case study" into the possibility of generalizing Chen's results, rather than a decisive conclusion on the generalizability of the results. Second, the classifications in this dataset did not account for nuanced sentiment score, one which simultaneously addresses multiple parties with independent sentiments. This also serves as an oversimplification of Chen's methodology.</p>
<p>Despite the slight differences in implementations, after the tweets were loaded into a dataset, a BERT encoder was trained on the input tweet data and subsequently processed the tweets into usable vectors to be trained by the two different neural networks. The tweet dataset was then split into an 80% training set and 20% test set to be fed into the neural networks for comparison. A CNN and FCN class were created as subclasses of the PyTorch neural network class, and the BERT-encoded tweets were fed into these networks to be trained.</p>
<p>The CNN consists of three convolutional layers, with output dimensions of 128, 256, and 528, respectively, each followed by a ReLU activation function and a max pool to down-sample the feature maps. The output of the third convolutional layer is flattened to prepare it for two fully connected layers, with the first one applying a ReLU activation function and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. The final output, representing class predictions, is obtained from the second fully connected layer. The FCN architecture is much simpler, consisting of three linear layers, with ReLU activations after the first and second layers. The first layer has an output dimension of 1000 and the second has 500, with the third layer having two output dimensions - one for each possible sentiment classification.</p>
<p>Both the FCN and CNN were trained over five epochs with an ADAM optimizer, using cross-entropy loss as the optimization function. The networks classified the tweets based on predicted sentiment, and the aggregate accuracy and F1 scores were calculated, to compare with the results of Chen's investigation.</p>
